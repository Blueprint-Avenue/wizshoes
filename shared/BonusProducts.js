        description: "By the time the Air Yeezy 2 SP ‘Red October’ finally launched online with no advance notice in February 2014, Kanye West had already severed all ties with Nike. Though chaos surrounded the shoe’s much-delayed release, the Red Octobers stand out from its two companion colorways. There’s the monochromatic scarlet finish, contrasted only by metallic gold lace tips, and there’s the unique design, which sees the side panels ditch the standard anaconda texture in favor of rows upon rows of small triangular studs."

Unlike its full-sized counterpart, this miniaturized pair features a simplified midsole and leather construction on the ‘wings’ and heel panel."
